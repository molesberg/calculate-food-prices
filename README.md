# calculate-food-prices
Start your own health food bowl restaurant!

A project for my wife from August 2023. She was considering selling health food bowls (like Sweetgreen or Fresh Kitchen). Given her food costs, she wanted to know what price she should pick for her bowls. I developed this code to calculate the distribution of prices she should charge (assuming restaurants charge the customer a price such that food costs average to 30% of the sale price). Then I gave her my results in tabular and visual formats.

We didn’t have data on what items were most popular because this was a new idea. I would recommend anyone using this code to optimize price based on popularity and market competitors in addition to the distribution of all possible combinations.

An improvement one could make to this code is to incorporate the profit from upsells (charging +$2.00 for steak) rather than assuming all bowls sell at the same price.

Note that “Plate” base in the excel file means the customer skipped the base.
